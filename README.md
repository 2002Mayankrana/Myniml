Project Overview:

This project is a fully functional live e-commerce website built using only frontend technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Despite being entirely frontend-based, it is designed to handle up to 50 orders per week effectively.

KEY FEATURES:

* Advanced Animations: I have incorporated new and exciting CSS and JavaScript animations to enhance the user experience.
* Frontend-Only Solution: Although I have the capability to develop full-stack solutions, this project demonstrates how to build an effective e-commerce site without a backend.
* Cart and Checkout: The cart and checkout logic is managed through user sessions, providing a fast and efficient method.
* Order Management: I integrated Google Sheets to handle order details, offering a straightforward and cost-effective solution for managing orders.

Why This Approach? 
This project showcases an innovative approach to e-commerce by utilizing frontend technologies to their fullest potential. Itâ€™s a practical and affordable solution for a new online business, emphasizing problem-solving skills and creativity in a purely frontend environment.
